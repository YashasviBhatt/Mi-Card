# mi_card

This is the First App I am making with the help of Flutter Course on Udemy.
- In this App I have made a Mi Card which is a virtual card that tells the user about a specific person's details like Person's Image, Name, Occupation, Phone Number, Email.
- In this App, I have used both:
  - Naive Approach i.e using `Container` Widget, and 
  - Obvious Approach i.e using `Card` Widget
- Here's how the app looks like.
